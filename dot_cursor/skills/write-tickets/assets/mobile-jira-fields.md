# Mobile Jira Fields

**Use the project config instead:** See **`projects/mobile-app.md`** in this skill for JIRA fields (project, component, sprint) for the guideline-app/mobile-app repo. The publish step uses `projects/` to resolve config by current repo; when you're in that repo, it uses `projects/mobile-app.md` automatically.
