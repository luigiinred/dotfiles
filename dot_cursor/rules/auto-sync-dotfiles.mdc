description: Auto-sync dotfiles after modifying skills or agents
globs:
  - "**/.cursor/skills/**"
  - "**/.cursor/agents/**"

After creating, editing, or deleting any file matching these globs, you MUST run the **sync-dotfiles** skill to sync changes to chezmoi. Read the skill at `~/.cursor/skills/sync-dotfiles/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow.
